# Final Year Project

To run the current state of the program:

1. Call "python3 main.py" in the product directory.
2. Enter an integer number for the dimensions of the maze, I recommend around 15-30.
3. Enter the agent type. Must be exactly "BFS", "DFS" or "UCS" representing breadth-first, depth-first or uniform-cost search respectively.

You can also run test1.py and test2.py for some comparison results.
